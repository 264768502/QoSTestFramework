# yonghao.zhao@intel.com
# 2017.6.6

### preparation
All download and dependencies are the same as Readme. Please read readme first.

### files we need
1. rec.yuv:     the subscribed video after undersampling.
2. recTime.txt: record the subscription time of each frame we stored in yuv.
3. recStat.txt: record all the info about subscription, such as bitrate, fps, packetlost and so on.
4. devicestime.log: record the time error between two phones.
5. localPublishTime.txt: record the publishing time of each frame. This file is related to the devicestime.log

### path settings
1. Originally, the file(1) is stored in /native/output and the other (2)-(5) are stored in /native/Data
2. You can also store the files as you like, but please edit the paths in basicServer_android.js, vmaf_calculate.py and NR_calcalate.py.

### how to start
1. prepare all the files and correctly set the path
2. cd to mcu-bench_cpp and "node basicServer_android.js"
3. click button about image quality.

### remark
the button "image quality(PSNR && SSIM && VIF)" will create a "send.yuv" in /native/output/ and "rec_timestamp.txt" in /native/Data. "send.yuv" is needed to calculate vmaf and "rec_timestamp.txt" is needed to calculate jitter and latency.



### run.sh
exmaple:  ./run.sh -p (publish equipment ID) -s (sub equipment ID)
run.sh will automatically call andoridtime.py
